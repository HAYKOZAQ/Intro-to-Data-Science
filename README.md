## Project Overview

This project showcases:

- Data Collection: Fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing data to remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Calculating key technical indicators such as:
  - Moving Averages
  - Bollinger Bands
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Visualization: Generating insightful plots, including:
  - Candlestick charts
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Trend analyses
- Backtesting Strategies:
  - Moving Average Crossover Strategy
  - RSI-Based Strategy
- Predictive Modeling:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
